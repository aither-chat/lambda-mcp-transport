# lambda-mcp-transport
AWS Lambda ServerTransport Based on Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This component provides a lightweight, serverless backend transport layer built on AWS Lambda for handling data exchange under the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By implementing the ServerTransport interface, it allows clients to communicate with an MCP server via HTTP APIs, enabling context synchronization, event routing, and remote procedure calls. Leveraging AWSâ€™s scalability and pay-per-use model, it's ideal for AI-driven applications requiring high availability with minimal infrastructure overhead.

Key Features:

No traditional server needed, low maintenance and deployment cost

Native support for MCP protocol, compatible with diverse context-driven workflows

Auto-scaling to handle high-concurrency requests

Seamless integration with AWS services like API Gateway and Lambda Layers
